# EAGLE
Eagle is a popular electronic design automation (EDA) software that is widely used in the industry for designing printed circuit boards (PCBs). Follow the steps instructions to get started with Eagle software.
## Step 1: Download and Install Eagle Software.
- [Go to the Eagle website](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download) and click on the **Download Now** button.
- Create an account or sign into your existing account.
- Select the appropriate version of Eagle for your os (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
## Step 2: Creating a New Project
- Open the Eagle software.
- Click on **File** and then **New** to create a new project.
- Enter a name for your project and choose a location to save it.
- Select a schematic template for your project.
## Step 3: Drawing Schematic
A schematic is a graphical representation of the electrical connections in your circuit.
- Open the schematic editor by clicking on **File** and then **New Schematic**
- Use the tools on the left-hand side of the screen to draw the components of your circuit. You can also use the search function to find specific components.
- Use the predefined library to get the components.
- Download [Adafruit & SparkFun](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/blog/library-basics-install-use-sparkfun-adafruit-libraries-autodesk-eagle) library to get all the components.
- Use **Add Part** tool to get the components or just do *ctrl+L* to activate the command line mode and type **add** then a pop window will appear showing the components list.
- The most used tools include **Add**, **Move**, **Rotate**, and **Delete**.
- To do the above operations, Click on the red colour plus(+) sign which is present either near the specific component or in the center of the component.
- Use the **Net** tool or type **net** to connect the components with wires.
- Save your schematic by clicking on **File** and then **Save**.
- After completing all, click Tools and do Electric Rule Check(ERC). 
- **Some hotkeys for drawing schematic are as follows:**
  - Add Part: *ctrl+shift+A*
  - Copy a component: *ctrl+shift+C*
  - Delete a component: *ctrl+D*
  - Move: *ctrl+M*
  - Rename a component: *ctrl+shift+N*
  - Change value of component: *ctrl+shift+V*
  - To run ERC: *ctrl+shift+E*
  - To see the error: *ctrl+E*
- **To transfer the schematic into layout in the schematic editor go the *File* and then *Switch to board***
## Step 4: Designing the PCB
Once you have created a schematic, the next step is to design the PCB board or layout.
- Open the PCB editor by clicking on **File** and then **Switch to Board**
- Click on **File** and then **Import** to import your schematic.
- Use the tools on the left-hand side of the screen to place the components on the PCB.
- Plan a floor plan to place the components in their suitable places to use more effective area.
- Use the **Route** tool to connect the components with copper traces.
- Add vias and through-holes as needed.
- Save your PCB design by clicking on **File** and then **Save**
